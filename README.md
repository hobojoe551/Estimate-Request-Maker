# Estimate-Request-Maker
A program that makes me estimate requests for my job. 

I have a few short and long term goals for this project. I will start off with the short term goals. 

Short-Term

1) I want to add buttons to my program in some way. I am guessing I will do this by adding the different types of estimate requests on each button to have it automatically spit them out to my clipboard. 
2) I want to make estimate requests go straight to my clipboard.
3) I want to be able to make different types of responses.
4) I want to make the program always roung up to the next 9.99. 
5) I want to make it be able to handle discounts too. 

Long-Term

1) I want to make the program be able to automatically grab the name and cost from an email. Obviously if the price isn't already in the email I will need to enter the price.
2) I want to make the program try and grab pricing from a spread sheet as much as possible and make me manually confirm.
